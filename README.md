Recoding a dock hunt type game

I've decided to recode this project to make it better than it was at first. In this game, you will find birds spawning infinitely and trying to reach you side of the map. There is no death/win fonction nore escape menu but only the basic gameplay for now.

All big birds have 30hp and the other have between 1 and 16hp.
All click remove to the target 10hp.

Have fun testing it !
